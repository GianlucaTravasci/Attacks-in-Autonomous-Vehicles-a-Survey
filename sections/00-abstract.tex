\begin{abstract}
    An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that can operates and perform actions under its own power. Autonomous vehicles basically works by sensing the environment, collecting information and managing communication with other vehicles. This is done with a combination of cameras, sensors, GPS, radar, LiDAR and computers. These technologies, used together, map vehicleâ€™s position and the proximity in order to take always the best decision. Because of their reliance on these sorts of technologies an autonomous vehicle need to be resilient against cyber attacks on them.
    Furthermore, these vehicles, in order to make always the right decision, must be connected to each other and to some road infrastructure. If these communication channels are not safe an adverasry can potentially steal private information and inject malicious data.

    This paper presents an overview of recent research on AV safety failures and security attacks, as well as the available safety and security countermeasures.
